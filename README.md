Kidney Stone Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Overview:
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for the classification of kidney stones from medical images. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient deep learning model that can automatically classify kidney stones into different types based on the images obtained from medical scans, such as CT scans or ultrasound images.

Dataset:
The model was trained and evaluated on a carefully curated dataset of kidney stone images. The dataset contains a diverse collection of kidney stone images with different shapes, sizes, and compositions, along with corresponding labels indicating the stone type. To ensure privacy and compliance, any sensitive patient information has been anonymized or removed from the dataset.

Model Architecture:
The classification model is based on a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The CNN model is chosen for its ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from images and its effectiveness in various computer vision tasks. The architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by max-pooling layers to downsample the feature maps. The fully connected layers are then employed to make the final classification decision.

Data Preprocessing:
Before feeding the images into the CNN model, various preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance the training process. Preprocessing steps include resizing the images to a standardized resolution, normalization, and data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training data.

Training:
The model was trained on a powerful GPU to expedite the training process. The training process involved optimizing the model's parameters using the Adam optimizer and minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss function. The model's performance was regularly monitored on a validation set to prevent overfitting.

Evaluation:
Once the model was trained, it was evaluated on a separate test set to assess its generalization ability. The classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix were used to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, ROC curves and AUC scores were calculated to assess the model's discrimination capabilities.

Results:
The performance of the CNN-based model on the test set was analyzed and documented. The achieved results are reported in the repository, along with visualizations of the model's predictions and evaluation metrics.
